# Sentimental-Artificial-Intelligence
• In the first part of the project we write a 4-layer neural network from scratch to identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using NumPy with an accuiracy of 84.48%
• After that we implemented the same in TensorFlow using Keras library to get an improved accuracy of 96.7%
• Lastlyt, we generate poetic texts by training a deep learning model on Shakespeare sonnets using LSTMs to get an accuracy of 84.94%
